# Luna

Luna is the first small and basic transformer based model I built when I was 16.
It can handle simple conversational tasks 
You can train Luna on your own dataset but this is a relatively basic model.

In a separate folder, I included a more efficient version that I built later, after learning more about model architectures and training algorithms.
Those improved versions reflect the progress I made as I studied transformers in greater depth.
